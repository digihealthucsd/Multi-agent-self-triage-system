# TriageMD
Multi-Agent Self-Triage System with Medical Flowcharts

# Brief explanation of the the repo
1. The structure of this repo is:    
    - Flowcharts: the flowcharts from the AMA Family Medical Guide book  
    - Model: all the scripts

2. Flowcharts:
    - flowchart_descriptions.txt is the document we use for flowchart retrieval.  
    - AMA_flowchart_description_preprocessed.csv is the csv version of the flowchart_descriptions.txt.   

3. Model:
    - system_implementation.py is the main script for the system development.    
    - flowcharts.py is the flowchart database that stores the flowcharts in graph representation (only ten examples are included for the copyright reason).  
    - evaluation.py is the script we use for evaluation tasks.  

# User Interface
